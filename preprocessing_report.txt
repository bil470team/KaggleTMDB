This text file will explain how preprocessing for "homepage", "overview", "tagline" and "status".

1) homepage
	'homepage' feature in general has 2 values. 
		-nan(missing value - in this case there is no homepage for the movie)
		-a link to homepage(so it exists)
	Due to 'homepage' getting only 2 values(absence/existence of a homepage), a new column 'has_homepage'
	was created by assigning values 0 and 1 for absence and existence of a homepage respectively.
	After the column creation, using seaborns catplot functionality the impact of homepage was reviewed.
	Reviewing graphical representation, it was seen that the feature 'homepage' had impact on the 'revenue'.
	So, in conclusion original 'homepage' feature was dropped from the dataframe and 'has_homepage' remained
	because it had processed binary values 0 and 1.
